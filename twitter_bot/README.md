## **Character Configuration**

### **1. Modify Default Character**

You can modify EcoNovaâ€™s default character by editing the `src/character.ts` file. Uncomment and edit the character configuration to change EcoNova's appearance, bio, lore, and more.

### **2. Use Custom Characters**

To load a custom character, specify the path to your character JSON file when starting the bot:

```bash
pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/custom.character.json"
```

You can load multiple characters at once by passing an array of paths.

## **Add Clients**

To define which platforms EcoNova will interact with, modify the `clients` array in either `character.ts` or `character.json`:

- **In character.ts:**

  ```ts
  clients: [Clients.TELEGRAM, Clients.TWITTER];
  ```

- **In character.json:**
  ```json
  clients: ["telegram","twitter"]
  ```

## **Start the Bot**

After configuring the environment and character, you can start the bot by running:

```bash
pnpm start --characters="characters/bot.character.json"
```
