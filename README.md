## 🌍 **Features**

### 🔹 **Zero-Knowledge BMI Checker**

EcoNova uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to verify a person’s **Body Mass Index (BMI)** without exposing private health data. This ensures:

- **Privacy-preserving health verification** 🔒
- **Eligibility-based donations without revealing user details** 🏥

---

### 🔹 **Automated Donations via Gelato**

EcoNova **automates** donation execution using **Gelato**, a decentralized smart contract automation protocol. This ensures:

- **Gasless & trustless transactions** ⛽
- **Smart contract-driven donation scheduling** 🕒
- **Fully autonomous fund distribution** 💸
- **No reliance on manual execution** 🚀

By integrating **Gelato**, donors can set predefined conditions (e.g., recurring donations, impact-based donations) that **execute automatically** when criteria are met.

---

### 🔹 **AI Tutor (Sonic & DeFiAI)**

EcoNova features an **AI-powered tutor** to educate users on:

- **Blockchain fundamentals** 🏗️
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** 💱
- **Smart contract security** 🔐

---

### 🔹 **Cross-Chain Transfers**

EcoNova enables **secure & cost-efficient cross-chain transfers** using:

#### 🔀 **deBridge for Sonic-to-BSC Transfers**

💱 **deBridge** allows seamless asset transfers from **Sonic to BSC**, enabling users to move funds between ecosystems efficiently.

- **Fast & cost-effective transfers** ⚡
- **Improved liquidity across chains** 🔄
- **Eliminates reliance on centralized bridges** 💡

#### 🔀 **LayerZero for EcoNovaToken Cross-Chain Transfers**

🌉 **LayerZero** powers **EcoNovaToken** transfers across multiple chains, ensuring:

- **Seamless interoperability between networks** 🔗
- **Trustless and decentralized bridging** 🏦
- **Efficient cross-chain transactions for donations & rewards** 💸
