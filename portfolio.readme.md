## **ðŸ”¹ How It Works**

### **Step 1: Collect Market Data**

- Fetch **real-time price feeds** from **Sonic blockchain oracles**.
- Analyze **on-chain metrics** (trading volume, liquidity, token movements).
- Track **user portfolio data** (wallet balances, transaction history).

### **Step 2: AI Market Analysis & Risk Assessment**

- Use **Machine Learning (ML)** models to:
  - Detect bullish/bearish trends.
  - Predict price movements using historical data.
  - Identify market anomalies & volatility.
- Implement **Risk Assessment Algorithms** to measure **portfolio exposure** and recommend adjustments.

### **Step 3: Portfolio Rebalancing Algorithm**

- Adjust asset allocation based on:
  - **User-defined risk tolerance** (conservative, moderate, aggressive).
  - **Market conditions** (AI detects market shifts).
  - **Pre-set strategies** (e.g., 60% BTC, 30% ETH, 10% stablecoins).
- Auto-adjust holdings via **smart contract execution** on Sonic.

### **Step 4: Yield Optimization**

- Allocate idle funds into **staking**, **liquidity pools**, or **DeFi lending** based on highest APY.
- AI tracks and reallocates funds between different yield opportunities.

### **Step 5: Portfolio Performance & Alerts**

- Provide real-time **portfolio analytics & insights**.
- Send **AI-driven alerts** for major market events (price crashes, liquidation risks).
